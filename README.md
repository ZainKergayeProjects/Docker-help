# Docker help for starters

## What to do first
1. 'docker build -t <name here> .'
*This builds your repo for a docker image*
2. 'docker images'
*You will want to find the tag of your docker img*
3. 'docker tag <tag here> <docker hub user here>/<repo name>:<tag here>'
*This will tag the docker image for the docker hub*
4. 'docker push <docker hub user here>/<repo name>:<tag id>'
*This will push your docker image to the docker hub where you already have a repo under the same name setup there*

All done!
